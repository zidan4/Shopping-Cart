# Shopping-Cart

freeCodeCamp Practice Project.

JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.



OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, developers use objects and classes to structure their code.

In this shopping cart project, I learnt how to define classes and use them. I created class instances and implement methods for data manipulation.

This project covers concepts like the ternary operator, the spread operator, the this keyword, and more.
